load the required packages first

library(mlr,quietly = TRUE)
library(dplyr,quietly = TRUE)
library(ggplot2,quietly = TRUE)
library(caret,quietly = TRUE)
library(purrr,quietly = TRUE)
library(data.table,quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(readr,quietly = TRUE,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

Load the test and train datasets

```{r}
train=read_csv("train.csv")
test=read_csv("test.csv")
```

Rbind the two datasets to perform feature engineering, will later separate the two datasets again. Remove the variable Sale Price from the training set

```{r}
SalePrice=train$SalePrice
train$SalePrice=NULL
train_test=rbind(train,test)
```
